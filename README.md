# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Project description :
 Nowadays the shift in focus of sales operations for goods and services from hand-to-hand to virtual sales is driving us to put greater emphasis on electronic selling 
 For years, online stores have been widely advised for businesses that rely on the selling of goods and services. These types of websites serve as a global device that connects clients to all relevant information, products, and services through a single portal.
 Those online shopping sites allow customers to take advantage of the available virtual fair which is updated daily without the slightest constraint, which will allow them to never miss their favorites, without problems of geographical distance, working hours or availability of transport. On the other hand, these sites allow the company to take advantage of this space to expose its products to a wider customer base.
 So, as a developer, I was asked to design and create an E-commerce web site for electronic devices which facilitates the communication between the product owners and the clients.

N.B: The work is done with the following technologies
- Backend: Mongodb.
- Frontend: Html5 - Css3 - Javascript -react - Bootstrap.

At the end of the project we managed to achieve a great success with a well-made platform while respecting the specifications and making our client very satisfied with the result.
